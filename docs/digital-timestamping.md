# Digital Timestamping
A timestamp proves that a contract, invoice, tax declaration, receipt or software was signed at a certain date and time. A Timestamp authority (TSA) typically provides two types of services, proof of time of a signature and long-term validity. 

- proof of time of a signature: 
Secure timestamps can be applied in digital signing of code and documents, to ensure the date and time of signing. 

- long-term validity
A long-term validity (LTV) signature helps preserve documents to enable validation of the signature also in the future.

- Trust service provider
Trust service providers (TSPs) can offer RFC3161-compliant timestamping as a service to other organizations.



A trusted digital timestamp gives you strong legal evidence that the contents of your work existed at a point-in-time and have not changed since that time. The procedures maintain complete privacy of your documents themselves.


### Problem: 
Timestamps that rely on system clocks are not enough, since it’s not difficult to alter the date and time locally on a machine. Plus, there are a variety of tools online that will allow you to change the modified, created and last accessed date of a document or PDF


### What is a Trusted Timestamp?
This is where ‘trusted’ timestamping comes in.  These types of timestamps are generated by a trusted third party using secure FIPS-compliant hardware, so they are not subject to manipulation by a local user. Trusted timestamping means that you can say with a high level of certainty that the date on the timestamp is accurate and hasn’t been tampered with.

[RFC 3161](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161) outlines the requirements a third party must meet in order to operate as a Timestamping Authority (TSA).
